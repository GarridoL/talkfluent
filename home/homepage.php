          <p>Hi, my name is Jeremy Carew-Reid,</p>
          <p>
            I  would like share with you the story of how I created the Talk Fluent Spanish Learning System.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many years ago, I was dating a beautiful girl from South America who was in Australia learning english. She was spending hours every day doing: 
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>Night Classes</li>
              <li>Online Courses</li>
              <li>Language Apps</li>
              <li>and using Textbooks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            She was putting in so much work but was not achieving success.  All these expensive courses and apps she was using was a total waste of time and money.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a painful and frustrating process to watch. So, in an act of desperation to help her I asked myself this question: 
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            <i>
              "What is the most effective and efficient way to quickly learn a new language?”
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well to answer this question, I needed to study the learning systems of the best language learners in the world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So, who are the best language learners in the world? 
          </p>
          <p>
            Well they do exist, they are known as polyglots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polygots are people who know multiple languages fluently. And not only do they know mutiple languages, but their pronunciation and memorization of these languages is also exceptional. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="with-margin">
          <h3>
            Here are some examples of some well-known polyglots...

          <p>
            Well your’re wrong...
          </p>
          <p>
            Most polygots are normal every day people but their secret to being so effective at language learning is because they have created highly efficient language-learning systems, strategies and techniques. 
          </p>

            And the good news is anyone can emulate their language learning techniques and achieve simular success.

            Well I spent two and a half years studying, compiling and synthesizing their systems, processes, and methodologies into a complete master language learning system. Plus I improved upon their structure by integrating it with modern technology.

          </h3>
          <p  style="margin-top: 25px;">
            The first stage in the Polyglot Spanish Learning System is to understand short, simple real-world conversation scripts between two native Spanish speakers. These conversation scripts created in our program are 10-15 sentences long making them easy to digest in minutes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We follow the 80/20 rule for efficient learning, introducing the most commonly used words, phrases, and sentences spoken in modern Spanish. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be learning practical conversation scripts that you can immediately use for travel, relationships and work. These conversation scripts are specifically structured from beginner-level to advanced and combined with modern technology and the science of mind comprehension.

            The third and last stage to the Polyglot Spanish Learning System is memorization. The key to memorization is using space repetition to memorize the conversation scripts consistent repetition of the Understanding and Pronouncing stages, followed by testing and practice. We follow the science of space repetition and let you learn an entire chunk of conversation script over the course of 5 days to ensure long-term retention.
