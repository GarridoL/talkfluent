            Hi my name is Jeremy Carew-Reid. I would like to share with you the story of how I created the Talk Fluent Spanish learning system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many years ago, I was dating a beautiful girl from South America who was in Australia learning English.

            <p>
              She was spending hours every day doing:

            She was putting in so much work but was not achieving success. All these expensive courses and apps she was using was a total waste of her time and money.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a painful and frustrating process to watch. So, in an act of desperation to help her I asked myself this question...

          </h2>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Well to answer this question, I needed to study the learning systems of the best language learners in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, who are the best language learners in the world? 
          </p>
          <p>
            Well they do exist, they are known as polyglots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polygots are people who know multiple languages fluently. And not only do they know mutiple languages, but their pronunciation and memorization of these languages is also exceptional.

              Sir Richard Francis Burton was a real-life Indiana Jones explorer in the 1800s who spoke 29 languages and countless dialects.

            <li>
              Giuseppe Mezzofanti was a hyperpolyglot who was known to speak 39 languages with rare excellence.

          <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            Most polygots are normal every day people but their secret to being so effective at language learning is because they have created highly efficient language learning systems, strategies and techniques. 
          </p>
          <p>
            And the good news is anyone can emulate their language learning techniques and achieve simular success.

              Well I spent 2.5 years synthesizing every known polyglot language learning technique into a hyper-efficient master language learning system.

              Plus, I radically improved upon their methodology by integrating it with modern technology.

            <p>
              All this combined knowledge resulted in the cretaion of the Polygot Talk Fluent Spanish Lauguage Learning System.

              This system is without doubt the fastest, most efficient methodology ever created that allows you to quickly and easily learn Spanish to fluency.
